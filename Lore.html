                <img class="center" src="images/Earth.jpg" alt="Planet Earth">
                <p>The homeworld and capital of humanity is entering a new golden age. The resource wealth of a dozen
                    settled colonies and a hundred industrial outposts flows back to Earth, fueling great works of
                    industry,
                    commerce, and art. The great cities are greening as arcology skyscrapers and telecommuting allow
                    more
                    efficient use of land.

                    Earth is still divided among nation-states, though all are affiliated beneath the overarching banner
                    of
                    the Systems Alliance. While every human enjoys longer and better life than ever, the gap between
                    rich
                    and poor widens daily. Advanced nations have eliminated most genetic disease and pollution. Less
                    fortunate regions have not progressed beyond 20th century technology, and are often smog-choked,
                    overpopulated slums.

                    Sea levels have risen two meters in the last 200 years, and violent weather is common due to
                    environmental damage inflicted during the late 21st century. The past few decades, however, have
                    seen
                    significant improvement due to recent technological advances.</p>

                <h3>The Alliance</h3>
                <img class="center" src="images/Alliance.jpg" alt="Systems Alliance Logo">
                <p>The Systems Alliance is an independent supranational government representing the interests of
                    humanity as
                    a whole. The Alliance is responsible for the governance and defense of all extra-solar colonies and
                    stations.

                    The Alliance grew out of the various nation space programs as a matter of practicality. Sol's
                    planets
                    had been explored and exploited through piecemeal nation efforts. The expense of colonizing entire
                    new
                    solar systems could not be met by any one country. With humans knowing that alien contact was
                    inevitable, there was enough political will to jointly fund an international effort.

                    Still, the Alliance was often disregarded by those on Earth until the First Contact War. While the
                    national governments dithered and bickered over who should lead the effort to liberate Shanxi, the
                    Alliance fleet struck decisively. Post-War public approval gave the Alliance the credibility to
                    establish its own Parliament and become the galactic face of humanity.</p>

                <img class="center" src="images/First Contact.jpg" alt="First Contact War Depiction">
                <p>Humanity's first contact with an alien race occurred in 2157. At that time, the Alliance allowed
                    survey
                    fleets to activate any dormant <a href="#mass relay">mass relays</a> discovered, a practice
                    considered
                    dangerous and irresponsible
                    by Council-aligned races. When a turian patrol discovered a human fleet attempting to activate a
                    relay,
                    they attacked. One human vessel survived, retreating to the colony of Shanxi.

                    The turians followed, quickly defeating the local forces. Shanxi was occupied, the first - and, to
                    date,
                    only - human world to be conquered by an alien species. The turians believed the handful of ships
                    they
                    defeated represented the bulk of human defenses. So they were unprepared when the Second Fleet under
                    Admiral Kastanie Drescher launched a strong counteroffensive, evicting them from Shanxi.

                    The turians mobilized for full-scale war, drawing the attention of the rest of the galaxy. The
                    Council
                    quickly intervened, forcing a truce. Fortunately for humanity, the First Contact War was ended with
                    a
                    diplomatic solution.</p>

                <img class="center" src="images/Asari.jpg" alt="Asari Councilor">
                <p>The asari were the first species to discover the Citadel. When the salarians arrived, it was the
                    asari
                    who proposed the establishment of the Citadel Council to maintain peace throughout the galaxy. Since
                    then, the asari have served as the mediators and centrists of the Council.

                    An all-female race, the asari reproduce through a form of parthenogenesis. Each asari can attune her
                    nervous system to that of another individual of any gender, and of any species, to reproduce. This
                    capability has led to unseemly and inaccurate rumors about asari promiscuity.

                    Asari can live for over 1000 years, passing through three stages of life. In the Maiden stage, they
                    wander restlessly, seeking new knowledge and experience. When the Matron stage begins, they 'meld'
                    with
                    interesting partners to produce their offspring. This ends when they reach the Matriarch stage,
                    where
                    they assume the roles of leaders and councilors.</p>

                <h3>Salarian</h3>
                <img class="center" src="images/Mordin.jpg" alt="Dr. Mordin Solus">
                <p>The second species to join the Citadel, the salarians are warm-blooded amphibians with a hyperactive
                    metabolism. Salarians think fast, talk fast, and move fast. To salarians, other species seem
                    sluggish
                    and dull-witted. Unfortunately, their metabolic speed leaves them with a relatively short lifespan;
                    salarians over the age of 40 are a rarity.

                    The salarians were responsible for advancing the development of the primitive krogan species to use
                    as
                    soldiers during the Rachni Wars. They were also behind the creation of the genophage bioweapon the
                    turians used to quell the Krogan Rebellions several centuries later.

                    Salarians are known for their observational capability and non-linear thinking. This manifests as an
                    aptitude for research and espionage. They are constantly experimenting and inventing, and it is
                    generally accepted that they always know more than they're letting on.</p>

                <img class="center" src="images/Turian.jpg" alt="Garrus Vakarian">
                <p>Roughly 1200 years ago, the turians were invited to join the Citadel Council to fulfill the role of
                    galactic peacekeepers. The turians have the largest fleet in Citadel space, and they make up the
                    single
                    largest portion of the Council's military forces.

                    As their territory and influence has spread, the turians have come to rely on the salarians for
                    military
                    intelligence and the asari for diplomacy. Despite a somewhat colonial attitude towards the rest of
                    the
                    galaxy, the ruling Hierarchy understands they would lose more than they would gain if the other two
                    races were ever removed.

                    Turians come from an autocratic society that values discipline and possesses a strong sense of
                    personal
                    and collective honor. There is lingering animosity between turians and humans over the First Contact
                    War
                    of 2157, which is known as the 'Relay 314 Incident' to the turians. Officially, however, the two
                    species
                    are allies and they enjoy civil, if cool, diplomatic relations.</p>

                <h3>Element Zero</h3>
                <img class="center" src="images/eezo.jpg" alt="Element Zero">
                <p>When subjected to an electrical current, the rare material dubbed element zero, or "eezo", emits a
                    dark
                    energy field that raises or lowers the mass of all objects within it. This "mass effect" is used in
                    countless ways, from generating artificial gravity to manufacturing high-strength construction
                    materials. It is most prominently used to enable faster-than-light space travel.

                    Eezo is generated when solid matter, such as a planet, is affected by the energy of a star going
                    supernova. The material is common in the asteroid debris that orbit neutron stars and pulsars. These
                    are
                    dangerous places to mine, requiring extensive use of robotics, telepresence, and shielding to
                    survive
                    the incredible radiation from the dead star. Only a few major corporations can afford the set-up
                    costs
                    required to work these primary sources.

                    Humanity discovered refined element zero at the Prothean research station on Mars, allowing them to
                    create mass effect fields and develop FTL travel.</p>

                <h3>Mass Effect Fields</h3>
                <img class="center" src="images/Mass Effect Fields.jpg" alt="Ship Drive Core">
                <p>Element zero can increase or decrease the mass of a volume of space-time when subjected to an
                    electrical
                    current. With a positive current, mass is increased. With a negative current, mass is decreased. The
                    stronger the current, the greater the magnitude of the dark energy mass effect.

                    In space, low-mass fields allow FTL travel and inexpensive surface-to-orbit transit. High-mass
                    fields
                    create artificial gravity and push space debris away from vessels. In manufacturing low-mass fields
                    permit the creation of evenly-blended alloys, while high mass compaction creates dense, sturdy
                    construction materials.

                    The military makes extensive use of mobility enhancing technologies, with mass effect utilizing
                    fighting
                    vehicles standard front-line issue in most military forces. Mass effect fields are also essential in
                    the
                    creation of kinetic barriers or shields to protect against enemy fire.</p>

                <img class="center" src="images/Mass Relay.jpg" alt="Mass Relay">
                <p>Mass relays are feats of Prothean engineering advanced far beyond the technology of any living
                    species.
                    They are enormous structures scattered throughout the stars, and can create corridors of virtually
                    mass-free space allowing instantaneous transit between locations separated by years or even
                    centuries of
                    travel using conventional FTL drives.

                    Primary mass relays can propel ships thousands of light years, often from one spiral arm of the
                    galaxy
                    to another. However, they have fixed one-to-one connections: a primary relay connects to one other
                    primary relay, and nowhere else. Secondary relays can only propel ships a few hundred light years,
                    however they are omnidirectional: a secondary relay can send a ship to any other relay within its
                    limited range.

                    There are many dormant primary relays whose corresponding twins have not yet been located. These are
                    left inactive until their partner is charted, as established civilizations are unwilling to blindly
                    open
                    a passage that might connect them to a hostile species.</p>
