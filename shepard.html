            <p>Commander Shepard is a legendary soldier within the Systems Alliance military. Shepard is known for their
                exceptional combat skills, tactical prowess, and charismatic leadership. Commander Shepard embodies the
                embodiment of a hero: brave, resourceful, and resilient. Their journey is not only a personal one but
                also a quest to unite the galaxy and inspire hope in the face of overwhelming odds.</p>
            <p> On a mission to Eden Prime, Commander Shepard stopped a plot to destroy the colony and retrieved a
                Prothean beacon, drawing
                the attention of the Council. After they proved that Saren Arterius, a Council Spectre was responsible
                for the attack, the council made the decision to make Shepard the first human Spectreâ€”a special agent
                with the authority to operate independently in order to preserve galactic stability. With the help of
                their crew, they track down and stop Saren from completing their plot to use the Citadel to wake the
                Reapers, an ancient A.I race with the sole goal of exterminating all intelligent life in the galaxy.</p>

            <h2>Pre-Military History</h2>
            <p>Shepard can be male or female, and can come from many walks of life before their military service.</p>
            <h3>Spacer</h3>
            <p>Shepard comes from a military family with a strong background in the Alliance military. Growing up,
                Shepard's parents were in the military, and this upbringing instilled discipline, respect, and a sense
                of duty in them. Once old enough, Shepard follows in the footsteps of their parents and enlists in the
                Alliance. The Spacer background provides Shepard with a unique understanding of military
                protocols and a familiarity with the challenges of service.</p>
            <h3>Earthborn</h3>
            <p>Shepard hails from the mean streets of Earth's megatropolis cities, such as Rio de Janeiro or London.
                An orphan on the streets, Shepard joins with a gang called the 10<sup>th</sup> Street Reds as a way to
                survive. Once they turned 18, they signed up with the Alliance to get away from gang life and towards a
                better future. Shepard's experiences on Earth have shaped their resourcefulness, street
                smarts, and ability to navigate the criminal underworld.</p>
            <h3>Colonist</h3>
            <p>Shepard grew up on one of humanity's colonies, Mindior which was attacked by a ruthless alien race known
                as the Batarians. Shepard survived the attack but lost family and friends in the process. The sole
                survivor of the attack, they are saved by a passing Alliance patrol and enlists with them. This
                background fuels
                a personal vendetta against the Batarians and a desire to protect humanity from further harm.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Defining Moment</h2>
            <p>Before becoming the legend they are, Shepard was already making a name for themselves as part of a
                significant event in Alliance history.</p>
            <h3>Sole Survivor</h3>
            <p>Shepard was part of a mission that went horribly wrong. While their unit was on the planet Akuze, Shepard
                and their unit were attacked by a thresher maw, a gigantic worm-like creature that devoured the rest of
                their squad. Injured and alone, Shepard had to survive physical and mental torments that would have
                broken most people, but they endured past it and now alone live to tell the tale.</p>
            <h3>War Hero</h3>
            <p>While on shore leave at the human colony of Elysium, the colony came under attack by a massive force of
                Batarian slavers. Were it not for Shepard, who risked their life by almost single-handedly holding back
                the invasion force to give time for reinforcements to arrive, the Alliance would have suffered a
                devastating loss. For their actions, Shepard was awarded the Star of Terra, the highest honor in the
                Alliance.</p>
            <h3>Ruthless</h3>
            <p>Shepard is dedicated to completing the mission, no matter the cost. On a mission on Torfan, Shepard sent
                a third of their unit to their deaths to take a position from Batarian slavers, executing those that
                surrendered. The day was won, but without the heavy cost of many soldiers. Shepard has a reputation for
                being cold and calculating, but when the Alliance cannot afford failiure, they are the first person they
                go to.</p>
