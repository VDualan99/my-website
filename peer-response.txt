1. Right away when opening the site on my browser I noticed that the total area the body takes up is about 50% of the screen when viewed on my 1440p monitor. 
Maybe you could adjust some of the CSS so the website scales up and not just down.

2. My last suggestion would be to move the menu to the top of the page under the title, it would keep the rest of the content centered. 
Although, I do think your design would be perfect for having another column on the right side, maybe more photos or links to other cool sites about the game.

3. Lastly I noticed that the media query of your Homepage is at 761px while your other two pages are at 814px. 
This causes an awkward issue where any display in between those two points jump between a web-focused view and mobile-focused view.

4. I encountered this weird bug with the media queries in the "Lore" and "Sections of the Citadel" pages where it would adjust if you shrink your browser window, 
but it wouldn't if you switched it to the phone view in the developer tools. I sent the website to my phone and it had the same error:

5. With the mobile layout of the home page, I believe that, while the "Brief History" section looks great being off-center in the web view, 
It would look great centered in the mobile view.

Based on my peer feedback, I moved the navigation menu to the top of the screen and positioned it horizontally so I could center the content of the body and make the site more symmetrical. I then added a media query to align them vertically when the screen size gets smaller. I also added multiple media queries to stop the navigation menu from overlapping the main content. Since my site's content was fairly small on larger monitors, I added a media query to increase the size of the body to better utilize the available screen real estate. For the last change to the media queries, I made them all have the same width barriers so changes to the size wouldn't be be jarring between different pages.
