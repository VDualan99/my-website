            <p>The Presidium is a vast, circular area with towering skyscrapers, lush gardens, and beautiful
                architecture. It is considered the most prestigious and exclusive district of the Citadel. The area is
                open to members of all races, but strict security measures are in place to maintain order and ensure the
                safety of the Council members and other important individuals.</p>

            <img class="center" src="images/presidium3.jpg" alt="Mass Relay Statue">
            <p>The Presidium is designed to create a serene and peaceful atmosphere. It features elegant walkways, calm
                water fountains, and carefully manicured gardens, creating a sense of tranquility amidst the bustling
                activity of the Citadel. The architecture incorporates a blend of organic and synthetic elements,
                reflecting the merging of different alien cultures and technological advancements.</p>

            <img id="krogan" class="center" src="images/presidium2.jpg" alt="Krogan statue">
            <p>A statue of a Krogan warrior is displayed at the edge of the lake. It was built to commemorate the
                efforts of the Krogan in the rachni wars, a conflict against an exponentially expanding insect race that
                lasted nearly 300 years. </p>

            <h2>The Tower</h2>
            <img class="center" src="images/tower2.jpg" alt="Tower Exterior">
            <p>The Citadel Tower is a colossal structure and serves as the heart of the Citadel.
                It is an iconic landmark, visible from various points within the Citadel. It features a
                distinctive, tapering design with multiple levels and a central spire that extends upward into space.
                The tower's exterior is constructed of sleek metallic materials, and its overall architecture blends
                futuristic aesthetics with grandeur.</p>

            <img class="center" src="images/tower1.jpg" alt="Council Chamber">
            <p>The interior of the Citadel Tower houses numerous administrative and governmental facilities, including
                the Citadel Council Chambers where the leaders of the major alien races convene. The Council Chambers
                are a circular room at the pinnacle of the tower, offering a breathtaking view of the surrounding space
                through large windows.</p>

            <img class="center" src="images/tower3.jpg" alt="Council Chamber">
            <p>The tower also contains other important areas, such as embassies representing different species, offices
                for diplomats and politicians, and various support facilities. The lower levels of the tower house
                docking bays for starships and transportation systems connecting to different parts of the Citadel.</p>

            <h2>The Wards</h2>
            <img class="center" src="images/Wards4.jpg" alt="Wards exterior">
            <p>Each of the five "arms" of the citadel house the colossal urban landscape known as the Wards. They serve as a
                vibrant and
                diverse melting pot, housing various alien species and
                serving as a hub for housing, commerce, and social interaction.</p>

            <img class="center" src="images/wards2.jpg" alt="Bustling underbelly">
            <p>The Wards are divided into several levels, each catering to different aspects of society. The lower
                levels of the Wards are often referred to as the "Lower Wards" or the "Undercity." These areas are
                characterized by crowded, dimly lit streets, with numerous shops, clubs, and bars lining the narrow
                pathways. The Lower Wards are home to some of the less fortunate inhabitants of the Citadel, including
                refugees and individuals seeking a life away from the prying eyes of the upper levels.</p>

            <img class="center" src="images/wards3.jpg" alt="Krogan statue">
            <p>As one ascends through the levels, the Wards become more affluent and developed. The middle levels are
                known for their bustling markets, luxury apartments, and high-end establishments. Here, one can find
                high-class restaurants, upscale stores, and extravagant entertainment venues. The middle levels also
                house important government offices, embassies, and corporate headquarters, making it a hub for political
                maneuvering and economic activity.</p>
