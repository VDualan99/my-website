            <h2>Brief History</h2>
            <p id="history"><strong>T</strong>he Citadel is a massive space station shrouded in mystery. Originally
                found by
                the Asari in 580 BCE (Human
                Calendar), it slowly became the center of galactic
                civilization as more and more races were invited or discovered the station.
                It is now home to over 13 million people of all races. Many races have their own embassies under the
                Council, made up of Asari, Turian, Salarian, and Human.</p>
            <p>No one knows it's exact origins, and it is maintained by a mysterious race of aliens known as the
                keepers.
            </p>
            <p>In 2183, the Citadel came under attack by the artificial intelligence race known as the Geth led by
                the
                rogue
                Council Specter Saren Arterius. Through the heroic actions of Commander Shepard and the noble
                sacrifice
                of
                many in the Alliance Navy's 5<sup>th</sup> fleet, they
                were able to save the Citadel and the Council.</p>
