        <h2>Brief History</h2>
        <p>The Citadel is a massive space station shrouded in mystery. Originally found by the Asari in 580 BCE (Human
            Calendar), it slowly became the center of galactic
            civilization as more and more races were invited or discovered the station.
            It is now home to over 13 million people of all races. Many races have their own embassies under the
            Council, made up of Asari, Turian, Salarian, and Human.</p>
        <p>No one knows it's exact origins, and it is maintained by a mysterious race of aliens known as the keepers.
