                <h2>Brief History</h2>
                <p id="history"><strong>T</strong>he Citadel is a massive space station shrouded in mystery. Originally
                    found by
                    the Asari in 580 BCE (Human
                    Calendar), it slowly became the center of galactic
                    civilization as more and more races were invited or discovered the station.
                    It is now home to over 13 million people of all races. Many races have their own embassies under the
                    Council, made up of Asari, Turian, Salarian, and Human.</p>
                <p>No one knows it's exact origins, and it is maintained by a mysterious race of aliens known as the
                    keepers.
                </p>
                <p>In 2183, the Citadel came under attack by the artificial intelligence race known as the Geth led by
                    the
                    rogue
                    Council Specter Saren Arterius. Through the heroic actions of Commander Shepard and the noble
                    sacrifice
                    of
                    many in the Alliance Navy's 5<sup>th</sup> fleet, they
                    were able to save the Citadel and the Council.</p>
